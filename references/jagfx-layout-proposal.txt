OLD GUI (JagFX – original internal tool)

The original JagFX interface was a low-level, developer-oriented editor that
exposed the .synth file format almost verbatim.

A sound was edited as one active voice at a time, chosen from up to ten voice
slots. All parameters for that voice were visible simultaneously, regardless
of relevance or complexity.

The main workspace was a fixed 3×4 grid of panels arranged by signal domain.
Rows loosely followed signal flow (pitch, amplitude, output), while columns
separated base envelopes, modulation envelopes, and analytic views.

Each editable panel was an envelope editor. Envelopes were defined by waveform
type, start and end values, and a list of time-segmented interpolation points
measured in milliseconds. Numeric fields operated directly on serialized
values. Average values were computed and displayed but not editable.

Time scaling and auto-fit controls affected only the viewport. Modulation
selection and envelope copying were handled through unlabeled or abbreviated
buttons, requiring prior knowledge of the synthesis model.

Filter analysis was shown in dedicated panels but editing was spatially
separated from the envelopes that modulated the filter. Additive oscillators,
feedback delay, looping, and playback controls were grouped at the bottom
without visual connection to the signal timeline.

The UI assumed strong familiarity with synthesis concepts, envelope-driven
modulation, and the RuneScape sound pipeline. It prioritized completeness and
directness over approachability or discoverability.

NEW GUI (Format-faithful, accessibility-oriented redesign)

The new GUI still edits one voice at a time and preserves a 1:1 mapping to the
.synth file format, but presents the voice as a guided signal flow rather than
a static grid.

A voice is displayed as a vertical stack of lanes on a shared timeline. Each
lane represents a functional stage in sound generation: pitch, amplitude,
gating, oscillators, feedback, and filtering. Time always flows left to right,
and all envelopes align on the same timeline.

Every envelope in the file format is visible as a curve, but envelopes are
grouped by purpose and labeled in plain language (e.g. "Pitch over time",
"Pitch wobble speed", "Pitch wobble amount"). Advanced users can still view
and edit raw segment data, but casual users interact primarily by dragging
points and durations.

Modulation is explicit and visual. Each envelope clearly states which
parameter it controls, and modulation depth is shown as an overlay rather than
an abstract range. No parameter requires selecting a hidden source; all
connections are visible by default.

Additive oscillators are shown as layered contributors beneath the main signal.
Each oscillator displays its delay, pitch offset, and volume as spatial
relationships on the timeline, making harmonic structure understandable
without prior theory.

Filter controls and analysis are colocated. When a filter is active, its
envelope, poles/zeros, and frequency response appear together, updating live
as parameters change. Users can adjust filters by manipulating either the
envelope or the response curve, with both views remaining synchronized.

The interface provides optional guidance layers. Users can enable presets,
tooltips, and simplified modes that limit visible parameters while still
writing fully valid .synth data. Advanced controls are progressively revealed
rather than hidden in separate tools.

Copying and reuse operate on named structures such as "envelope", "oscillator",
or "voice" instead of anonymous buttons. Actions describe intent rather than
implementation.

The new GUI allows users with little synthesis experience to create sounds by
direct manipulation and visual feedback, while still giving expert users full
access to the exact data structures and behaviors defined by the original
format.
