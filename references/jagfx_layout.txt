How was original JagFX laid out in GUI side?

In the following grid:

### TOP..MIDDLE ---

[Freq Base]     [Freq Mod rate]     [Freq Mod range]    [Graph of poles/zeros]
[Amp Base]      [Amp Mod rate]      [Amp Mod range]     [Transition Curve]
[Final Output]  [Gap off]           [Gap on]            [Frequency Response]

---

these grid cells:
[Freq Base]     [Freq Mod rate]     [Freq Mod range]
[Amp Base]      [Amp Mod rate]      [Amp Mod range]     [Transition Curve]
[Final Output]  [Gap off]           [Gap on]

had the following title buttons:
{1x}{2x}{4x}{..}{M...}{*down_arrow*}

what exactly was '..' 'M...' and down_arrow are unknown as we've never seen their full names,
nor have we seen them clicked/used in any developer video we've gotten.

however, these two: [Graph of poles/zeros] and [Frequency Response]:
only contain these:
{1x}{2x}{4x}{..}

What even were 1x 2x 4x for?

### BOTTOM ---

# Editing Tone section                                                                          # Mode (used to display the last 3 filter-related panels at the far right only, or all at once)
[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10]     [Harmonic1][Harmonic2][Harmonic3][Harmonic4][Harmonic5]     [Main][Filter][Both]
      [Copy][Reset Active]          |Semi: ...||Semi: ...||Semi: ...||Semi: ...||Semi: ...|
                                    |Vol : ...||Vol : ...||Vol : ...||Vol : ...||Vol : ...|

There was also Reverb with values 'Reverb vol' and 'Reverb del' next to Harmonic5

# To left were settings and various buttons for some elements:
0 - [Off]
1 - [Sqr]
2 - [Sin]
3 - [Saw]
4 - [Noise]
5 - [Triangle] # <-- this doesn't exist, but some files actually contained a "5th" waveform called Triangle. For full support, we could add this!
Min Hz: ...
Max Hz: ...
Avg Hz: *immutable calculated value*

# these were seen on Gap Off/On panel controls.
[Off]
[On]
Min Gap: ...
Max Gap: ...
Avg Gap: *immutable calculated value*

Len ms: ^... # these were up-down text fields
Pos ms: ^...
L1 ms : ^...
L2 ms : ^...

[Play]
[Play All] # meant to play all "tones" at once
[Loop]
[Loop All] # meant to loop all tones maybe?

Loops
^...
=== # this is a groupbox in original, same with harmonics

[Stop]
[Load]
[Save]

[True Wave] # this always showed up as toggled on, so what even does this do?

At the end of day, we never had hand or code into the original, so we don't know what more there could be.

Best to just design properly around the file format, and the idea behind a wavetable synthesizer with additive synthesis.
