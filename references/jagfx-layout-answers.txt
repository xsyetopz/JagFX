Q: What are `{1x}{2x}{4x}` buttons on each envelope graph?
A: These are zoom controls for graph’s time scale.
   - Envelope segments are measured in milliseconds.
   - Each voice can have different duration, so fixed scale doesn’t work.
   - Filter envelopes update at fixed rate (256 samples).
   - Buttons only change how graph looks, not actual data. This helps you see both short and long sounds.

Q: What is `{..}` button after zoom controls?
A: This is auto-fit button.
   - It adjusts graph so all envelope segments fit in view.
   - It ignores total voice duration and focuses on envelope’s data.
   - It’s also used on poles/zeros and frequency-response graphs to fit data.

Q: What is `{M...}` button found on most envelope graphs?
A: This is modulation source selector.
   - It opens menu to choose what controls curve.
   - Possible options:
     - Base envelope
     - LFO rate envelope
     - LFO depth envelope
     - Gate envelope
     - Filter envelope (if available)
   - Only shown on graphs that can be modulated.

Q: What is `{↓}` (down-arrow) button on envelope panels?
A: This is copy or transfer button.
   - It copies current envelope to another tone slot, multiple tones, or all tones.
   - Useful for working with 10 tones and reusing envelope shapes.
   - There are also global "Copy" and "Reset Active" buttons.

Q: Why do "Graph of poles/zeros" and "Frequency Response" only have `{1x}{2x}{4x}{..}`?
A: These are visualizations, not editable data.
   - You can only zoom or auto-fit view.
   - No envelope to copy or modulation source to select.

Q: What does "Editing Tone [1–10]" represent?
A: Lets you pick one of 10 voices in `.synth` file.
   - Each slot is voice definition.
   - Empty slots are marked with `0x00`.

Q: What are Harmonic 1–5 controls?
A: These add extra oscillators to base waveform.
   - Each maps to oscillator in file:
     - `Semi` is pitch offset
     - `Vol` is amplitude
     - `Del` is delay
   - UI shows 5 harmonics, but format allows up to 10.

Q: What are "Reverb vol" and "Reverb del"?
A: These are feedback delay (echo) settings, not true reverb.
   - They set feedback amount and mix.
   - Names are for convenience.

Q: What does "Mode: Main / Filter / Both" do?
A: Shows or hides filter panels in UI.
   - Doesn’t affect file saving or sound generation.

Q: What are Gap Off / Gap On panels?
A: These are gate envelopes for silence and active time.
   - They match optional gate envelope pair in voice.
   - "Avg Gap" values are shown but can’t be changed.

Q: Why is "Triangle" mentioned when it doesn’t exist in shipped assets?
A: It was probably used in early tools.
   - File format officially supports waveforms 0–5.
   - Triangle may have been experimental or removed.
   - It’s fine to add it for editing, as long as it exports safely.

Q: What does "True Wave" do?
A: Switches between band-limited (anti-aliased) and basic waveforms.
   - On: uses band-limited oscillators.
   - Off: uses simple math, which can cause aliasing.
   - Usually kept on, especially at 22,050 Hz.
