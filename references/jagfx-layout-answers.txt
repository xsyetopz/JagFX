Q: What are the `{1x}{2x}{4x}` buttons on each envelope graph?
A: Horizontal time-scale zoom controls for the graph viewport.
   - Envelopes are segment-based and measured in milliseconds.
   - Voices have independent durations, so a fixed scale is impractical.
   - Filter envelopes update internally at a fixed rate (256 samples).
   - These buttons change only the visual time scale, not the underlying data,
     allowing inspection of both very short transients and long sounds.

Q: What is the `{..}` button after the zoom controls?
A: Likely a "Fit to Data" / auto-scale control.
   - Recomputes the graph’s horizontal scale so all segments fit within view.
   - Ignores absolute voice duration and focuses only on the envelope’s data.
   - Present even on poles/zeros and frequency-response graphs because:
     - Frequency response can be auto-fit to pole spread.
     - Poles/zeros graphs can auto-center and scale the complex plane extents.

Q: What is the `{M...}` button found on most envelope graphs?
A: Probably a "Modulation Source" selector.
   - Opens a small modal or popup to choose what drives the displayed curve.
   - Likely options included:
     - Base envelope
     - LFO rate envelope
     - LFO depth envelope
     - Gate (gap) envelope
     - Filter envelope (when applicable)
   - Only present on time-varying or modulatable graphs.
   - Absent on purely analytic views like poles/zeros and frequency response.

Q: What is the `{↓}` (down-arrow) button on envelope panels?
A: Likely a copy / apply / transfer control.
   - Used to copy the current envelope to:
     - Another tone slot
     - Multiple tones
     - Possibly all tones
   - Fits the workflow implied by:
     - 10 editable tones
     - Reusable envelope structures
     - Separate global "Copy" and "Reset Active" buttons

Q: Why do "Graph of poles/zeros" and "Frequency Response" only have `{1x}{2x}{4x}{..}`?
A: These are derived, non-editable visualizations.
   - No envelope data to rebind or copy.
   - No modulation source to select.
   - Only zoom and auto-fit are meaningful.

Q: What does "Editing Tone [1–10]" represent?
A: Direct selection of the 10 possible voices in the `.synth` file.
   - Each slot maps to one voice definition.
   - Empty slots serialize as a single `0x00` marker.

Q: What are Harmonic 1–5 controls?
A: Additive oscillators layered on top of the base waveform.
   - Maps directly to oscillator entries in the file format:
     - `Semi` -> Pitch Offset
     - `Vol`  -> Amplitude
     - `Del`  -> Delay
   - UI exposes 5 harmonics even though the format allows up to 10 oscillators.

Q: What are "Reverb vol" and "Reverb del"?
A: Feedback delay (echo) parameters, not true reverb.
   - Correspond to:
     - Feedback Amount
     - Feedback Mix
   - Naming reflects intended usage rather than DSP accuracy.

Q: What does "Mode: Main / Filter / Both" do?
A: UI visibility toggle only.
   - Controls whether filter-related panels are shown.
   - Does not affect serialization or synthesis behavior.

Q: What are Gap Off / Gap On panels?
A: Gate envelopes controlling silence and active durations.
   - Correspond to the optional gate envelope pair in the voice structure.
   - "Avg Gap" values are derived and immutable.

Q: Why is "Triangle" mentioned when it doesn’t exist in shipped assets?
A: Early or internal tooling likely supported it.
   - File format officially defines only waveforms 0–5.
   - Triangle may have been experimental or deprecated.
   - Adding it for editor completeness is reasonable if exported safely.

Q: What does "True Wave" do?
A: Toggles band-limited (anti-aliased) waveform generation.
   - On: proper band-limited oscillators.
   - Off: naïve waveform math with audible aliasing.
   - Almost always enabled in practice, especially at 22,050 Hz.
